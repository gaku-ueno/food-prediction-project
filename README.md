# Analysis of Food.com recipe features and their ratings

Authors: Gaku Ueno & Neil Dewan

## üìñ Introduction

In a world increasingly shaped by the internet, one constant remains: people's love for food. Online recipe platforms like **Food.com** have become essential resources for home cooks, culinary enthusiasts, and professional chefs alike. With over **500,000 recipes**, Food.com provides a rich dataset to explore user preferences and culinary trends.

This project investigates the relationship between recipe characteristics‚Äîparticularly **calories**‚Äîand user-generated **ratings**. Using recipes and ratings posted since 2008 on [Food.com](https://www.food.com/), originally utilized in the recommender system research paper *"Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences"* by Majumder et al., we will apply statistical modeling techniques to uncover meaningful patterns. Specifically, we will build predictive models to understand how nutritional content influences user ratings.

## üìö Dataset Overview

### üçΩÔ∏è Recipes Dataset  

The recipes dataset contains information about recipes posted on Food.com. It includes **231,637** rows with the following 10 columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                             |

## üéØ Question  

We aim to answer the question: What are the most important features when predicting the rating?


Let's dive into the analysis! üöÄ

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### üîó **Merging Datasets**

The first step we took was merging the **recipe** and **review** dataframes to match each review with its corresponding recipe. This allowed us to have a complete record for each observation‚Äîboth the recipe's attributes and its associated reviews.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è **Handling Missing Ratings**

Next, we inspected the `rating` column. Since ratings are provided on a 5-point scale (**1‚Äì5**), any entry with a **0 rating** indicates that a rating was not actually submitted in the review. To accurately reflect this, we replaced these 0-star ratings with `np.nan`. This approach prevents artificially lowering the average rating during statistical analyses.

### üçé **Extracting Nutritional Information**

Following the treatment of ratings, we turned our attention to the `nutrition` column. Originally, this column contained a composite string with multiple nutritional components combined together. To facilitate analysis and feature engineering, we decomposed this field into several distinct columns. Specifically, we extracted values for:

- ‚úÖ **Calories (#)**
- ‚úÖ **Total fat (PDV)**
- ‚úÖ **Saturated fat (PDV)**
- ‚úÖ **Protein (PDV)**
- *(and other relevant nutritional attributes)*

The percent daily value (**PDV**) indicates how much a nutrient in a serving contributes to a typical daily diet.


### üìä **Feature Engineering: `calorie_range`**

We introduced an additional categorical feature, `calorie_range`, believing that calorie content could significantly influence user ratings. We classified recipes into four categories based on calorie content:

| Calorie Range | Calories                |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Low           | [0‚Äì25th percentile)     |
| Medium        | [25th-50th percentile)  |
| High          | [50th-75th percentile)  |
| Very High     | [75th-100th percentile) |

**Cleaned Data Frame**  

| name                                 |     id |   minutes | submitted   |   rating |   avg_rating_per_recipe |   calories (#) |   total fat (PDV) |   sugar (PDV) |   sodium (PDV) |   protein (PDV) |   saturated fat (PDV) |   carbohydrates (PDV) | calorie_range   |

### Univariate Analysis

We created 3 plots for univariate analysis

Our first plot is a bar plot of the counts of the recipes of each rating in the Dataset.
